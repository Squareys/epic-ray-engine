A Java Raycasting Engine


If interested in helping  me with this project, be free to contact me via twitter, facebook or tumblr.

This is a true raycasting engine. Meaning, the rendering code actually uses raycasting tecniques and 
doesn't just immitate them. An editor comes along in the code aswell.

Features
--------

The current features are implemented at the moment
- Engine:
  - Wall rendering: textured or single color
  - Floor/Ceiling Rendering: single color
  - Keyboard movement and world collision
  - zBuffer (makes way for fog and masked texture implementation)
- Editor: 
  - Basic tilemap editor
  - Basic tilecreator/editor
  - Play the game directly in the editor! :)

Todos
-----
