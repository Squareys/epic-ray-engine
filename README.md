EpicRay
=======

*Archived, badly documented, buggy and untested, but fun and well-optimized "Modern Raycasting Engine in Java"*

![epic-ray-engine.png](imgs/epic-ray-engine.png)

I abandoned this project, but if you are interested in working on it, please do open a pullrequest.

This is a "true" raycasting engine. What that is supposed to mean is that the rendering code
actually uses raycasting techniques and doesn't just try to immitate the look. An editor
comes along in the code aswell.

# Building

This repository contains two [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) projects.
There are no further dependencies, it should "just work".

Simply open Eclipse, right-click in the "Package Explorer", "Import" > "Existing Projects into Workspace",
then select the repository root directory and hit "Finish".

# Launching

In Eclipse, right-click "EpicRay" or "EpicRayEditor" and "Run As..." > "Java Application".

A example map file can be found under `EpicRayEditor/file.dat`. You should resize the Window after loading it,
it looks like there is a bug which doesn't force the redraw.

# Getting Started

`main(...)` is in `de.squareys.epicray.engine.Main`.

`de.squareys.epicray.engine.EpicRayRenderer` generates `EpicRayRay`s, which are the
"work unit" for the thread pool.

I hope you can work from there.

# Features

The current features are implemented at the moment
- Engine:
  - Wall rendering: textured or single color
  - Floor/Ceiling Rendering: textured or single color
  - Keyboard movement and world collision
  - zBuffer (makes way for fog and masked texture implementation)
  - Threaded Rendering
- Editor:
  - Basic tilemap editor
  - Basic tilecreator/editor
  - Loading and saving
  - Play the game directly in the editor! :)

# Todos

Here are some todos you could do, if you are thinking of contributing:
- Engine:
  - Sprite Rendering
  - Player spawn
  - Mouse movement
  - Postprocessing framework and effects (fog, dof, ...)
  - Background image
  - Lighting, maybe?
- Editor:
  - Resource manager dialog for textures and other assets
  - Player spawn
  - Background image
  - Better data/functionality/gui separation
